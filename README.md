This is some fun with playstation 1 homebrew. Thanks to [sapphrodite](https://github.com/sapphrodite) for the MMIO code.\
There isn't much here yet, but I hope to do some cool things with this.\
TODO:
1. Comment MMIO code
2. Add GCC-ELF to PS-EXE converter to makefile
3. Figure out debugging with PCSX-REDUX
